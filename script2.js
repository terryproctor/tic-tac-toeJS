// So, the main problem is 
//       const selectCell = () => {
//         _selectedVal = gameDom.addEventListener('click', on)
//         return
//        }

// If you put it inside a loop, you are attaching multiple click listeners to gameDom which will fire all at once when clicked. So, you have to find another way of doing it. 
// One suggestion I can think of:
// Keep the event listerner to gameDom always and switching the player based on whose turn it is.

// This is not the only solution though, you can try other things as well.
